      <li><a href="https://github.com/kelseyleewerner/Epicodus.git">My First Webpage</a></li>
      <p>This was my first attempt at initializing a repository and committing changes to GitHub as well as using Atom.  I created a simple web page to practice using block and inline elements as well as styling text with HTML.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kelseyleewerner/wednesdayjan13.git">Cupcakes and Shoes</a></li>
      <p>I created created two simple websites using HTML and a CSS stylesheet to practice styling with classes as well as organizing with divs and spans.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kelseyleewerner/wednesdayjan20.git">A Cookie Recipe</a></li>
      <p>To practice making a layout with floats, the box model, cascading, and best practices in code indentation and spacing, I created a simple website using HTML and a CSS stylesheet.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kelseyleewerner/mondayjan25.git">The Ideal Vacation</a></li>
      <p>I styled a website using HTML, a custom CSS stylesheet, and Bootstrap classes.</p>

    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <p><span class="color-match-a"><em>This is just the beginning!</em></span> My first introduction to coding was dabbling with the Android track on Treehouse using Java and JavaScript.  However, my experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the Intro to Programming course has been infinitely more hands-on.</p>
    <p>I'd say I'm currently a complete beginner, but I'm really excited to take what I learn at Epicodus even further.  As a Quality Engineer, I'll primarily be doing manual testing in the beginning, but eventually, I'd like to be able to automate more of my work.  Learning more about Ruby will be my next step in that direction - look out for project updates as I get a handle on the basics!</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>After graduating with a BA in History & International Relations from the College of William & Mary, I’ve worked in sales and customer service positions across a variety of industries.  I’ve spent the last three years at CrowdCompass helping event planners to create mobile apps for their conferences and trade shows.  As an Account Executive, I’ve managed a book of business of $1.2 million with clients ranging from name brand corporations to niche associations and was the highest gross earner on my team in 2015.</p>
    <p>After moving from my company’s HQ in Tysons Corner, VA to our Technology office in Portland, OR, I’ve realized what I was missing out on behind the scenes!  I began learning to code as a way to explore my interest in a more technical career path, and it has lead me to finding a new passion for all aspects of mobile development.  I’m very excited to say that I’ll be taking on a new role as a Quality Engineer at CrowdCompass in just a few weeks. STRONG TAG</p>

    <h2>About My Pictures</h2>
    <p>There’s more to me than what I do in the office:</p>
    <p>UL TAG THEN LI TAGS I grew up in Northern Virginia and spent the last 5 years living in the District of Columbia.  I love all of the artistic and cultural activities in the city and hope to find more of the same out west. I went to the College of William & Mary, one of the oldest colleges in the US.  I spent the last two years of school living in colonial Williamsburg. I studied abroad in South Africa.  I travel a lot and hope to go back to Cape Town some day. I love working in mobile technology and really feel like I have a home at CrowdCompass.  I can’t wait to immerse myself further in the development process. I accomplished one of my life-long dreams a few months ago when I moved to Portland.  I spend plenty of weekends hiking near the city, and Mt Hood is one of my favorite views. This is a photo of my cat, Princess Diamond.  We’re coming up on our one year anniversary!</p>
